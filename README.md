# Risk & Reward
Is a clone of the Risk board game featuring local multiplayer. While I remember wanting to, I never was able to get around to adding online support. Some rules of the original Risk board game may be missing or changed based on how I and my friends used to play the game.

This is an old project I created in May of 2019 using Unity 2019.2.

### Platforms:
Mobile, PC, or web.

### How to play:
The game is designed around touch-screen controls so the keyboard is not used.

Select the number of players to play with by dragging the slider left or right.

In the "deploy" phase of play, tap/click a territory to deploy a unit to it. Units can only be deployed to a territory the player already occupies unless they do not occupy any space on the map yet.

After a player completes their turn, pass the controls to the next player. Each player should memorize their team color.

During the "attack", a player can click/tap and drag from a territory they have at least 2 units in to a neighboring territory they do not occupy to attack it.

When engaging in battle, tap/click and drag on the dice to roll them one at a time, then pass the controls to the defending player so that they may roll their dice.

During the "maneuver" phase, tap/click and drag from an occupied territory with at least 2 units in it to another territory occupied by the same player to move units between them.
